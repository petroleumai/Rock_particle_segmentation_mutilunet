# Rock_particle_segmentation_mutilunet
This study presents a novel deep learning framework for the accurate segmentation of rock thin-section images, a task of critical importance for mineral identification, quantitative petrographic analysis, and downstream applications in geology and drilling engineering. Traditional segmentation methods relying on manual annotation or handcrafted image processing often struggle to cope with the textural complexity, irregular grain morphologies, and subtle boundaries inherent to thin-section images.
To address these challenges, we propose an enhanced U-Net-based architecture that incorporates attention mechanisms to improve feature discrimination and capture contextual information. Additionally, we introduce a multi-scale, multi-view feature extraction strategy, where convolutional kernels of varying sizes are employed to extract features from mineral structures of different sizes and morphologies, while polarization diversity enables the model to better perceive anisotropic mineral properties. This design allows the model to robustly handle complex particle distributions with overlapping, occluded, or fine-scale features.
In support of this work, we have also constructed a high-quality, multi-polarized rock thin-section dataset, along with a scientifically rigorous grain annotation standard. This labeling protocol defines consistent rules for handling particle boundaries, occlusions, and microfractures, ensuring the structural and semantic integrity of training data and promoting robust model performance across varied geological scenarios.
